# Technical Documentation of World Population Model

In this document, we present a multi-component model and the approach to the integration of the model.  This large multi-component model will be presented in its entirety and proposed methods of integration.  In the previous chapter, we examined how to handle complexity.  Once complexity of the system is characterized quantitatively, we can proceed to model these behaviors as endogenous processes.  We explore ways to build an integrated model that has population dynamics as an endogenous variable in the model that is coupled within a feedback loop.

## Motivation

The intended purpose of this integrated model was four important questions: (i) how does human population growth impact climate change; (ii) what are the feedback loop effects between climate change and economic and social systems; (iii) what is the carrying capacity in terms of food, land, and natural resources and how does the population dynamics in different income regions behave due to an ecological overshoot; and (iv) how will inequality be exacerbated due to these changing factors and what kind of implications does that have on public health (e.g. disparity of food access during to famines).

## Structural Framework

The model that is introduced here is meant to capture feedbacks between each submodel.  We have created seven distinct submodels: 

* Population (Regional)
* Economy (Regional)
* Health and Education (Regional)
* Food (Global)
* Climate (Global)
* Water (Global)
* Resources (Global)

The model is laid out in the following.
